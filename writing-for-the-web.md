## What is this section?

**This is a draft overview of the key things you need to be thinking about when preparing information for the web.**

Writing for the web is different to writing for print. 

Content must be user-focused, readable (and scannable) and accessible across all devices. 

Much has been written on this topic and can be researched on the web. 

Doing web writing training is also important, even if you have been a writer or editor for many years or are a digital native who was born or went to school in the digital era.
