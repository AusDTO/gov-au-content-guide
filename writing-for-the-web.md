**An overview of the key things you need to be thinking about.**

Writing for the web is different to writing for print. 

Content must be user-focused, readable (scannable) and accessible across all devices. 

Much has been written on this topic and can be researched on the web. 

Doing web writing training is also important, even if you have been a writer or editor for many years.
