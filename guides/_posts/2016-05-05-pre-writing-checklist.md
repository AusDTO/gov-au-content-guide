## Does this content meet a user need?

User needs can be functional or emotional (we care about both). Sometimes they’re created needs (created by things that the government needs them to do). Content always needs to address the user's main needs so they can act on what we're asking them to do so they can solve their problem quickly and efficiently.

In order to understand user needs it helps to actually meet users and observe how they are currently solving the problem your information intends to improve within the right context.

## What is the aim of the content?

It’s difficult to write information for your audience if you don’t have a clear purpose. Identify the aim of your content so you know what to prioritise and how much detail your user needs. For example: this piece of content will help people work out their aged pension entitlement.

## Does this content already exist?

If so, decide if existing content needs to be re-written or archived. Make your decision based on all searchable content. If the content originates on another website link to it so the source of truth is with the content owner.

## Is there a lifecycle plan for this content?

Make sure your content remains up-to-date and relevant. Set reminder dates in the Content Management System or plan with your content team to regularly review and maintain it.
