## Develop a list of authentic keywords

Including the right words (keywords) that people are using to search for your information is extremely important. And
it’s worth remembering that what the government calls something, doesn’t always match up to the words that users key into their search engine.

Use relevant keywords prominently and appropriately in titles and subheadings, as well as in body text (especially in the first 2 to 3 paragraphs).

**For example**

If you were writing about aged health care, you would include keywords such as nursing homes, help at home, homecare, independent living etc.  This way you adapt your writing style to the language of the people who you want to read it.

## Keyword analytics tools

You can gain insight into search terms by using analytics such as [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) and then use this insight to optimise your content and metadata. Visit the [Google Analytics Academy](https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/).

The [AdWords Keyword Planner tool](https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner) provides great insight and analytics into keywords that are popular and relevant for your web page–even if you’re not using it for  AdWords campaigns. Use the keywords as a solid foundation for content to connects with your users and direct them to your site.

[Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/ "Google Trends") provides guidance in identifying and selecting keywords. It is a public web facility based on Google Search. It shows how often a particular search term is entered relative to the total search volume across various regions of the world, and in various languages.

## Write a succinct meta description

Your meta description displays in a search result. Use 160 characters to be specific and highly relevant so as to be understood out of context. Write for the audience and use verbs to motivate them to click, so they can find out or do something specific.

The description should:

- contain the main and unique points of the page to help users decide whether to click
- clearly cover the context of the web page and the intended audience–to allow a non-expert to understand what the page is about and it’s what they’re looking for
- include keywords close to the start of the description–this is better for users and search engines
- use full sentences whenever possible to aid usability and readability.

**For example**

This description of the Digital Transformation Office’s website succinctly describes the agency’s key role in active voice.

<img of dc. metadata from dto.gov.au (that isn’t actually in the `head <meta>`` section of the live site?) which should also be turned into `code` and not be an image?>

<img screencap of the DTO metadata being used in the google search listing>

Caption: Meta title and description as they display in a search result.

## Write naturally for your users

- To improve the usefulness of your content
- create content including keywords that your users are searching for
- ensure your most important content is in HTML so search engines can find it and index it
- use your keywords at least once, prominently near the top of the page
- take a considered approach to repeating your keywords throughout your content. Only repeat where it makes sense and is in context.

In general, you should create content that suits online audiences (for scannability from top to bottom rather than reading from left to right) and that:

- Is clearly structured and signposted with subheadings
- is written in plain English and is accurate and information rich
- contains keywords naturally, strategically, consistently and in context.

Specifically, you must:

- write accurate, meaningful and unique page titles and subheadings
- use keywords prominently and appropriately in titles, text and metadata
- have a unique succinct description in the metadata.
