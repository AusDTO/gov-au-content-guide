## Use an active voice

Active voice clearly identifies who is doing what to whom, is more immediate and generally uses fewer words.

For example:

> The director approved the proposal for the new part-time role.

Passive voice sounds evasive and sends the reader backwards.

For example:

> The proposal for the new part-time role was approved by the director.

Passive is acceptable where there is no do-er.

For example:

> The proposal for the new-part time role was approved in March.

## Personalise the language

Use first and second pronouns (‘I’, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘you’) to establish a connection with users.

Use ‘they’ when talking about, rather than to someone or something.

For example:

> The department is launching its website when they are ready to go live.

## Use fewer words

Check your content and remove unnecessary words, sentences and paragraphs. 1 idea per paragraph makes information easier to follow.

## Minimise punctuation

It’s easier to read several short sentences than a long sentence broken up with punctuation.

## Don’t use jargon or ‘fancy’ language

Write as your users talk rather than how government speaks internally. Keep it conversational for easier comprehension.

## Think of people who don’t use English as a first language

Read back what you’ve written to check that it could be understood by someone who speaks English as a second, third, fourth etc language.

Consider whether the information should also be provided in appropriate community language—a good idea if there are compliance requirements.
