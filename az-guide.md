## What is this?

This is an early release of an A to Z guide about style, grammar and spelling conventions. It's here to help teams create simpler, clearer and faster information.

We have written guidance that is precise and specific, with practical examples.

The content in this guide will be extended and new topics added based on your needs and feedback.

## Who is it for?

The guide is for all content creators and transformation teams working with the Digital Transformation Office.

We welcome this guide being adopted across government and hope that it is a starting point for further conversations, new content processes and ways to work together.

## Why is this guide being released as a draft?

We believe that making things open makes them better. Itâ€™s one of the [Digital Transformation Office design principles](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/design-principles/). We plan to test this draft version of the guide, incorporate feedback and iterate regularly.
