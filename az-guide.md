## What is this?

This A to Z directory covers style, grammar and spelling conventions.

It is an early release and not complete.

New topics will be added over time based on interest and feedback.

Weâ€™ve included practical examples which we plan to extend.
 
We have deliberately written this information to be minimal and precise.

Simpler, clearer and faster government information is our goal.
