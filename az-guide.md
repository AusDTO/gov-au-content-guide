## What is this?

This draft A to Z style guide covers style, grammar and spelling conventions.

It is an early release and not complete.

New topics will be added over time based on interest and feedback.

We’ve included practical examples which we plan to extend.

We have deliberately written this information to be minimal and precise.

Simpler, clearer and faster government information is our goal.

## **Who is it for?**

The guide is for all content creators and transformation teams working with the Digital Transformation Office. We welcome this guide being adopted across government and hope that it is a starting point for further conversations, new content processes and ways to work together.

## **Why is this being released early?**

We believe that making things open, makes them better. It’s one of [our design principles](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/design-principles/ "our design principles"). We plan to test this draft version of the guide, incorporate feedback and iterate regularly.
