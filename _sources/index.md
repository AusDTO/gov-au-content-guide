## What sources were used to create the Draft Content Style Guide v1.0?

We have been closely guided by the GOV.UK [Government Digital Service (GDS) Style Guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide) and [blog](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/).

Weâ€™ve used content from the Department of Communications and the Arts Online Style Guide with their permission (recently updated in March 2016) and from the [DTO's Digital Service Standard Design Guides](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/design-guides/).

We have referred to respected resources including the 18F.gsa.gov [18F Content Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/), [The Guardian and Observer style guide](https://www.theguardian.com/info/series/guardian-and-observer-style-guide), the [Macquarie Dictionary](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/) and the [Department of Finance's Good practice publishing for Australian Government entities](https://www.finance.gov.au/publications/good-practice-publishing/).

The authors of this draft guide have used their combined 50 years experience working with digital content.
