## What sources were used to create the Content Style Guide (draft)?

We have been closely guided by the GOV.UK style guide and their blogs.

We’ve used content from the Department of Communications and The Arts style guide with their permission (which was recently updated) and from the DTO’s online writing section in the Standards.

We have referred to respected resources including The Macquarie Dictionary, the US Government’s 18F, The Guardian and The Observer style guide and good practice publishing information from the Department of Finance.

The authors have also used their combined 50 years experience of working exclusively in digital content.
