**This is a draft high-level summary of the key things you need to be thinking about when preparing information for the web.**

Writing for the web is different to writing for print. Content must be user-focused, readable (and scannable) and accessible across all devices.

You need to think differently about how you may normally write, even if you are a digital native. You need to do the hard work to make it simple for users.
