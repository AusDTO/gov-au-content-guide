**This is a draft overview of the key things you need to be thinking about when preparing information for the web.**

Writing for the web is different to writing for print. Content must be user-focused, readable (and scannable) and accessible across all devices.

This is a high-level summary of things you need to think about when writing for the web.

Writing for the web requires you to think differently about how you may normally write, even if you are a digital native. You need to do the hard work to make it simple for users.
