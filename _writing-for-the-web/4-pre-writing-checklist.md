**A little planning goes a long way and can avoid duplication of information. Before writing your content please check these points.**

### Does this content meet user needs?

User needs can be functional or emotional --- we care about both. Sometimes they’re created needs (created by things that the government needs them to do).

Content always needs to address the user's main needs so they can act on what we're asking them to do so they can solve their problem quickly and efficiently.

In order to understand user needs it helps to actually meet users and observe in the real environment how they are currently solving the problem your information intends to improve. Read about the [Discovery stage](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/discovery/).

### What is the aim of the content?

It’s difficult to write information for your audience if you don’t have a clear purpose. Identify the aim of your content so you know what to prioritise and how much detail your user needs.

### Does this content already exist?

Decide if any existing content needs to be re-written or archived. Make your decision based on all searchable content. If the content originates on another government website, link to it so the source of truth is with the content owner.

### Is there a lifecycle plan for this content?

Make sure your content remains up-to-date and relevant. Set reminder dates in the Content Management System, and plan with your content team and stakeholders to regularly review and maintain it.
