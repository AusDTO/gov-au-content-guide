**What exactly is a content designer?**

A content designer is both a writer and editor who understands the web and its users. We work as part of a multi-disciplinary team to help create purposeful government services that feature simpler, clearer and faster information.

A content designer analyses every piece of content based on what the user needs to know.

Good content designers can pivot quickly as a project’s scope changes (a natural part of any creative process), innovate, initiate and anticipate. We are sticklers for quality. We understand readability, usability and accessibility, and we know that plain English always wins.

### It’s not just writing or editing

Traditionally, content people play a role where we ‘fix' the content, often towards the end of a project. Typically we take existing content created by someone else and shape it, or we generate words from scratch based on research passed on to us.

But content design goes deeper than that. In this role we get to really be part of the thinking around:

* **what** information will be created (not always just words)
* **why** will it be created
* **how** it will look once it’s laid out.

Our writing and editing skills are still critical, and play a strong role in the many rounds of iterating that are part of each project. But our overall job is to make the information simpler, clearer and faster. This is a team effort.

### Embrace user research (the Discovery stage)

The creation of good content ideally begins at [Discovery](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/discovery/) at the very first user research session where the content designer takes on the role of observer.

The insights gained from listening and reflecting on what real people say, think and do in relation to the topics that we end up researching and writing about, is invaluable.

This chance to participate gives you the language, the different perspectives and an understanding of the pain points. These naturally get reflected back into the voice and style of the content we help create.

It also helps us get across the decisions that will be made about the information we eventually help generate.

When a content designer comes in later to a project, where the Discovery stage has already started, it’s essential to go back over the research archives and have conversations with the service designers and other content designers who were at the initial sessions.

### Get used to working closely with others

In agile teams no-one works in a silo, including content designers. The experience is highly collaborative across the whole team.

This is fantastic in that content people get to be part of the conversation and decision-making. It gives us a chance to gain insights about the subject from various angles, which means we are better in tune with what the end-state might be.

And when it comes to the final stages of editing there is more efficiency and co-operation around our changes because we have been part of the conversations and ensuring consensus along the way.
