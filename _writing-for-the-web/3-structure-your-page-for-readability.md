**Pages that are badly structured and difficult to scan are often ignored, especially if users are reading on a mobile or tablet screen. Lead the user through your information by following these points.**

### Identify the aim

Identify the aim of your content to know the level of detail you need. Focus on how the user should do something, rather than telling them about something. Make calls to action clear and simple.

### Put the most relevant information first

Don't waste the reader's time by burying what's most relevant to their needs at the bottom of a page. The most relevant information should sit close to the top of the page.

### Use headings and subheadings

Headings are signposts in text and navigational aids. Readers use headings to scan content and to gauge the relationship between, and importance of, sections of text.

When designing the flow of information on a web page structure your content with hierarchical headers (H1, H2, H3). Use meaningful text and keywords in headers and links

#### Limit levels

Content should only have 1 top level (H1) heading. Be careful with the number of headings added beyond this. Readers will lose track if there are too many heading levels. Short content should only use 2 extra subheading levels (H2 and H3).

#### Use space

To aid readability and comprehension, use headings to break up text and draw in the reader.

To support both navigation and access, use a heading at least every 100 words or so (every 2 to 3 paragraphs).

#### Be interesting

Make headings specific enough to catch the reader’s attention. You should either provide information or raise a query.

Avoid meaningless words for headings such as general, miscellaneous, other, or more.

#### Keep it short

Try to limit headings to less than 1 line. Headings that spill over to a second line are harder to read and to recall.

### Chunk in short paragraphs

A paragraph is a section of text that contains a single idea.

State your idea in the first sentence. This will attract your reader’s attention and get your message across.

Readers often scan headings and first sentences of paragraphs as they search for the information they want.

Limit paragraphs to 2 to 3 sentences at the most.

### Use simple sentences

Use short sentences that contain a single message. If you need to communicate other messages use a second sentence, commas or brackets.

Vary the length of your sentences to make content less tiring to read. For many people comprehension can start to fail after 25 to 30 words, so this should be the limit of your longest sentences.

### Break up content with lists

If you have long sentences with many elements, use a list to break up the text and make it easier for your reader to understand and scan.

Use bullet lists by default. You should only use numbers or letters when it is necessary to show a priority order or chronology.
