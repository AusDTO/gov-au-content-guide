**Information that is accessible should be written in plain English so it can be understood by everyone, regardless of ability.**

### Use an active voice

Active voice clearly identifies who is doing what to whom, is more immediate and generally uses fewer words.

**For example**

> The director approved the proposal for the new part-time role.

Passive voice sounds evasive and sends the reader backwards.

e**For example**

> The proposal for the new part-time role was approved by the director.

Passive is acceptable where there is no do-er.

e**For example**

> The proposal for the new-part time role was approved in March.

### Personalise the language

Use first and second pronouns (‘I’, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘you’) to establish a connection with users.

Use ‘they’ when talking about, rather than to someone or something.

For example:

> The team will do user research so they understand the needs of users.

### Use fewer words

Check your content and remove unnecessary words, sentences and paragraphs. Use 1 idea per paragraph to make information easier to follow.

### Minimise punctuation

It’s easier to read several short sentences than a long sentence broken up with punctuation.

### Don’t use government speak

Write as your users talk rather than how government speaks internally. Leave out the jargon. Keep it conversational for easier comprehension.

### Think about non-native English speakers

Read back what you’ve written to check that it could be understood by someone who speaks English as a second, third, fourth etc language.

Consider whether the information should also be provided in appropriate community languages---a good idea if there are compliance requirements.
