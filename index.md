This guide is for all content creators and transformation teams working with the Digital Transformation Office.

We welcome this guide being adopted across government and hope that it is a starting point for new conversations and ways to work together.

## Why is this guide being released as a draft?

We believe that making things open makes them better. Itâ€™s one of the [Digital Transformation Office design principles](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/design-principles/). We plan to test this draft version of the guide, incorporate feedback and iterate regularly.

## How is this guide related to the Digital Service Standard?

The [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/) requires teams to build services using a [style guide for online content](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/6-consistent-and-responsive/). This is the first release of guidance that will eventually become the style guide for digital content.

## How was this guide put together?

We asked our peers across government what they wanted in this guide. There were common themes: keep it up-to-date, make it easy to understand and give us examples. We were also guided by many expert sources. Read the blog on [how we put together the Content Style Guide](https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/walking-the-talk/).
