This is a draft of a new Content Guide designed to help government content creators create simpler, clearer and faster information. It captures the latest thinking in online content with a strong focus on accessibility.

## Who is it for?

This guide is for all content creators and transformation teams working with the Digital Transformation Office. We welcome this guide being adopted across government and hope that it is a starting point for new conversations and ways to work together.

## Why is this guide being released early?

We believe that making things open, makes them better. It’s one of [our design principles.](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/design-principles/ "DTO design principles") We plan to test this draft version of the guide, incorporate feedback and iterate regularly.

The Digital Service Standard references an [online style guide](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/design-guides/online-writing/ "Online style guide") This will eventually be replaced by the information in this Content Guide once we have received feedback and made changes.

## How was this guide put together?
