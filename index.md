## What is this draft?

This is a draft of a new guide designed to help government teams create simpler, clearer and faster information. It captures the latest thinking in online content with a strong focus on accessibility.

Please give feedback: email [gov.au-guide@digital.gov.au](mailto:gov.au-guide@digital.gov.au)

## Who is it for?

This guide is for all content creators and transformation teams working with the Digital Transformation Office.

We welcome this guide being adopted across government and hope that it is a starting point for new conversations and ways to work together.

## Why is this guide being released as a draft?

We believe that making things open makes them better. Itâ€™s one of the [Digital Transformation Office design principles](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/design-principles/). We plan to test this draft version of the guide, incorporate feedback and iterate regularly.

## How is this guide related to the Digital Service Standard?

The [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/) requires teams to build services using a [style guide for online content](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/6-consistent-and-responsive/). This is the first release of guidance that will become the style guide for digital content.

## How was this guide put together?

We asked our peers across government what they wanted in this guide. There were common themes: keep it up-to-date, make it easy to understand and give us examples. We were also guided by many expert sources. Read the blog on [how we put together the Content Style Guide](https://www.dto.gov.au/blog/walking-the-talk/).
