A call-to-action is a prompt (usually a link) for your user to do something else based on the information provided.

Depending on the context, using a verb is helpful in motivating or instructing the user to act.

**For example**

> apply now, check your access, compare time zones etc.

Be brief and consistent when using the same call-to-action across a website. Avoid dead-end pages as they are not useful or helpful.
