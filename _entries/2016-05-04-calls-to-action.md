## Calls-to-action

A call-to-action is a prompt (usually a link) for your user to do something else based on information provided. 

Depending on the context, using a verb is helpful in motivating or instructing the user to act eg apply now, check your access, compare time zones etc.

Be brief and when using the same calls to action across a website, be consistent.

Avoid dead-end pages as they are not useful or helpful.
