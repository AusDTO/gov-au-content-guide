A call-to-action is a prompt (usually a link) for your user to do something else based on the information provided.

Depending on the context, using a verb is helpful in motivating or instructing the user to act.

**For example**

> Apply now
> Check your access
> Compare time zones

Be brief and consistent when using the same call-to-action across a website. Avoid linking to dead-end pages as they are not useful or helpful.
