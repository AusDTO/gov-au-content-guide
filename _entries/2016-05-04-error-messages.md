## Error messages

Error messages should have a polite, sympathetic tone that helps the user understand what to do next.

Use this format for questionnaires: apology first and then a clear instruction of whatâ€™s required second.

**For example**

> Sorry, we need more information.
>
> Please tell us your street address.

**For 404s**

Personalise the message with an apology and redirect the page back to the homepage or similar.

**For example**

> Sorry this page no longer exists. Please return to the homepage.
