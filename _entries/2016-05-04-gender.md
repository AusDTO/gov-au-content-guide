Use gender-neutral job titles.

**For example**

> - worker instead of workman
> - business manager or business person instead of businessman or businesswoman
> - chairperson instead of chairman or chairwoman

Avoid using gender-specific singular pronouns (he/she, her/his, her/him) by rewriting the sentence.

**Use this**

> Every employee should fill out an employment declaration.

**Not this**

> Every employee should fill out his employment declaration.
