## Translations

Content written in plain English is easier to translate (and read). But translating is not just about the words, itâ€™s also about capturing the meaning of what you are communicating within the context of a culture.

If your content needs to be translated, best practice is for this to be undertaken by [NAATI-accredited translators](https://www.naati.com.au/) and independently checked by another accredited translator.

Where a PDF version needs to be made available in multiple languages, publish them alongside a plain English version in HTML. All PDFs need to be made accessible.
