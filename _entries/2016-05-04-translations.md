Content written in plain English is easier to translate (and read). But translating is not just about the words, itâ€™s also about capturing the meaning of what you are communicating within the context of a culture.

If your content needs to be translated, best practice is for this to be undertaken by [NAATI-accredited translators](https://www.naati.com.au/) and independently checked by another accredited translator.

See the Department of Social Services [Multicultural Language Services Guidelines for Australian Government Agencies](https://www.dss.gov.au/settlement-and-multicultural-affairs/programs-policy/multicultural-access-and-equity/multicultural-access-and-equity-resources). 

Where a PDF version of content needs to be made available in more than one language, publish the PDFs alongside a plain English version in HTML.
