## Inclusivity & diversity

When preparing content for people who have come to Australia from non-English speaking countries, you should recognise cultural diversity and specific needs — while not stereotyping or making assumptions.

Avoid jargon and limit contractions. 

Use language to connect with all users respectfully and politely regardless of origin and ability. 

Avoid discriminatory language that treats some people differently from others.

### Preferred terms

- People with disability — not people with a disability, or disabled or handicapped people
- Intellectually impaired, not intellectually disabled
- Hearing impaired not deaf
- Visually impaired not blind
- Older people or seniors not pensioners, old-age pensioners or the aged
- Young people not youth or juveniles

### Diversity

Speak to the person (in plain English, without jargon) rather than speaking to their difference. This avoids getting caught up in semantics and is respectful of:

- cultural differences
- differences in socioeconomic background
- differences in educational levels and systems
- generational differences
- gender roles
- perceptions of social and support concepts
- political impacts on life events
- pre and post effects of wars
- religious affiliations
- values or philosophical differences.
