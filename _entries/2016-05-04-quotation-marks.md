As a general rule use single quotation marks.

**For example**

> The director said ‘Work-life balance is an important part of our organisation’s success.’

Double quotation marks should be used for a quote within a quote:

> The team leader said "We need to follow the director’s advice that ‘work-life balance is part of our organisation’ in order to be successful."

## Colloquial expressions

Use single quote marks for enclosing and emphasising an unusual expression.

**For example**

> They refer to it as the ‘content focus’ model.
