## Quotation marks

As a general rule use single quotation marks.

**For example**

> The director said 'Work-life balance is an important part of our organisation's success.'

**For example**

Double quotation marks should be used when using a quote within a quote:

> The team leader said "We need to follow the director’s advice that 'work-life balance is part of our organisation' in order to be successful."

### Colloquial expressions

Use single quote marks for enclosing and emphasising an unusual expression eg *The DTO runs ‘in-flight’ assessments on transformation projects*.
