Don't use Latin abbreviations: eg, ie, etc and nb.

Spell out the full phrase or rewrite the content.

If space is limited, for example in a table, you can use 'eg'. Only do this if your users can understand it (sometimes screen readers won't read it correctly).

**For example**

- 'for example', not eg
- 'that is' or 'meaning', not ie
