Don't use Latin abbreviations: eg, ie, etc and nb.

Use 'for example' instead of eg.

If space is limited, for example in a table, you may need to use eg. Only do this if your users can understand it (sometimes screen readers won't read it correctly).

Avoid using 'that is' or 'meaning' for nb. Rewrite and restructure your content instead.
