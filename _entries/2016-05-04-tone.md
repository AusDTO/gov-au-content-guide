## Tone

The GOV.AU tone is direct, calm and understated. Speak politely and use language that is positive but sensitive and respectful. 

Always use the simplest and least number of words and write in plain English. Get to the point.

Never use jargon or write in a bureaucratic style.

Be aware who you are writing for. Be conscious of the context of their task. Tell them what they need to know.

**Be personable**

Make content personal and natural by using first and second person (I, we, us and you) rather than third-person nouns (such as Australian Government Department of Finance) and pronouns (he, she, it and they).

**Like this**
