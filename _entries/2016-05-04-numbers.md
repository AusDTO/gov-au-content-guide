Numbers are easier to read on a screen than words, so use them where possible.

Use a comma for every third digit from the right upwards from 10,000.

Use a word for people or animals upwards from 1 million, for example 22.3 million.

**For example**

> - 1 to 9, not one to nine
> - 10 to 9999
> - 10,000 to 1 million

**More examples**

> - 100s of them
> - 5kg
> - 50KB
> - 10am
> - $2
> - 75%
> - Section 10
> - 19th century
> - 1980s
> - 25 people went to the launch
