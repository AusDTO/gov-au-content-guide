Numbers are easier to read on a screen than words, so use them where possible. 

**For example**

> - 1—9, not one to nine
> - 10—999,999

Use a word for people or animals upwards from 1 million eg 22.3 million.

**More examples**

> - 100s of them
> - 5 kg
> - 50KB
> - 10am
> - $2
> - 75%
> - Section 10
> - 19th century
> - 1980s
> - 25 people went to the launch
