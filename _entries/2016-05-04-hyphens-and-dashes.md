Use hyphens when 2 or more words form an adjective, for example 'a first-class experience'.

Do not use hyphens when joining an adverb to a noun, for example 'highly intelligent'.

Some nouns are also hyphenated, for example about-face, air-conditioning. Check the Macquarie Dictionary.

Note login is not hyphenated.

**For example**

> You need to use your login (noun) to log in (verb) to the site.

Hyphens can be used to differentiate meaning in verbs. For example 'the group is going to re-form' or 'we need to reform the policy'.

Use when the second word is ‘up’ (for example meet-up), or when the first and second word ends with the same letter (for example re-engage).

### Em dashes

Use em dashes with a space on either side ( --- ) when adding an idea to a sentence or instead of starting a new sentence.

**For example**

> 27% of Australians were born overseas --- another 2.5% identify as being Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

- In Microsoft Word: hold down the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key, type <kbd>0151</kbd> on the numeric keypad and then release the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key

- In [kramdown Markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) notation: use 3 hyphens (<kbd>---</kbd>)
- Google Docs: go to Insert then Special characters.

### En dashes

Use em dashes (---) instead of en dashes (--) to break up sentences.

Use ‘to’ in time and date ranges --- not hyphens or en dashes.

**For example**

> - We are open Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm.
> - GovHack runs 29 to 31 July 2016.
