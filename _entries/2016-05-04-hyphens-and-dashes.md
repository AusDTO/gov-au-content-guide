Use hyphens when 2 or more words form an adjective eg a first-class experience.

Do not use hyphens when joining an adverb to a noun eg highly intelligent.

Some nouns are also hyphenated eg about-face, air-conditioning. Check the Macquarie Dictionary.

Note login is not hyphenated.

**For example**

> You need to use your login (noun) to log in (verb) to the site.

Hyphens can be used to differentiate meaning in verbs eg the group is going to re-form, or we need to reform the policy.

Use when the second word is ‘up’ eg meet-up, or when the first and second word ends with the same letter eg re-engage.

### Em dashes

Use em dashes without a space on either side (---) when adding an idea to a sentence or instead of starting a new sentence.

**For example**

> 27% of Australians were born overseas---another 2.5% identify as being Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

### En dashes

Use em dashes (---) instead of en dashes (--) to break up sentences.

To indicate spans of time or page numbers etc use the word 'to' or 'from' preferably or a hyphen.

**For example**

- from page 64 to 78 or page 64-78
- from 10am to 11am or 10am-11am.
