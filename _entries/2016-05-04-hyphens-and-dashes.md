## Hyphens & dashes

Use hyphens when 2 or more words form an adjective eg a first-class experience.

Don’t use hyphens when joining an adverb to a noun eg highly intelligent. 

Many commonly used words are hyphenated eg log-in. Check the Macquarie Dictionary.

Hyphens can be used to differentiate meaning in verbs eg the group is going to re-form, or we need to reform the policy.

Use when the second word is ‘up’ eg meet-up, or when the first and second word ends with the same letter eg re-engage.

Use em dashes without a space on either side (—) when adding an idea to a sentence or instead of starting a new sentence.

**For example**

27% of Australians were born overseas–another 2.5% identify as being of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander origin.
