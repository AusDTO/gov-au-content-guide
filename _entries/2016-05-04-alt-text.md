Images must have alternative text (or alt text) to describe the information or function of the image.

Al text sits behind the image and appears when an image is disabled, fails to load or when people with low vision or reading difficulties use screen readers or speech input software.

When content includes images, you must write the alt text. Different types of images have different alt text requirements:

### Informative images

Informative images should have a short description conveying the essential information presented by the image.

> Example to come.

### Complex images

Complex images such as graphs, charts and diagrams only need a short alt text but they should link to a longer description or table of data.

> Example to come.

### Non-decorative images

All non-decorative images should be referenced in the surrounding text.

> Example to come.
