Images must have text alternatives to describe their information or function.

Alternative text (or alt text) is the text used to describe an image. It sits invisibly behind the picture and appears when images are disabled or fail to load, or the page is read aloud by screen readers or text-to-speech software. This technology is used by people with low vision or reading difficulties.

When including images in content you must also write the alt text.

Different types of images have different alt-text requirements:

**Example to come**


Informative images should have a short description conveying the essential information presented by the image (think tweet length if possible -- 140 characters).

**Example to come**


Complex images such as graphs, charts and diagrams only need a short alt text but they should link to a longer description or table of data.

**Example to come**


All non-decorative images should be referenced in the surrounding text.
