Images must have alternative text (or alt text) to describe the information or function of the image.

Alt text sits behind the image and appears when an image is disabled, fails to load or when people with low vision or reading difficulties use screen readers or speech input software.

When content includes images, you must write the alt text.

Different types of images have different alt text requirements. You can use an [alt text decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) to help you work out what kind of alt text you need.

### Informative images

Informative images should have a short description conveying the essential information presented by the image.

**For example**

> Example to come.

### Complex images

Complex images such as graphs, charts and diagrams only need a short alt text but they should link to a longer description (long text) or table of data.

You should also write content near the complex image that explains why it is there and what it shows.

### Non-decorative images

All non-decorative images should be referenced in the surrounding text.

**For example**

> Example to come.
