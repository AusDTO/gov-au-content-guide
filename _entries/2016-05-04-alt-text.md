Images must have alternative text (or `alt` text) to describe the information or function of the image.

Alt text sits behind the image and appears when an image is disabled, fails to load or when people with low vision or reading difficulties use screen readers or speech input software.

When content includes images, you must write the alt text.

Different types of images have different alt text requirements. You can use an [alt text decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) to help you work out what kind of alt text you need.

### Decorative images

If an image is just decoration you should use a null (empty) alt text: `alt=""`.

### Informative images

Informative images convey a simple concept or information that can be expressed in a short phrase or sentence.

Informative images need:

- to be referenced in the surrounding text
- a short `alt` text that briefly describes the content (this should be different from the text of a caption)
- a short description conveying the essential information presented by the informative image.

### Complex images

Complex images such as graphs, charts and diagrams need:

- a short `alt` text that briefly describes the content (this should be different from the text of a caption)
- content near the image that explains why it is there and what it shows or highlights
- a clear text link that leads to a page with the long text alternative and possibly the associated data.

Long text alternative is a full description of a complex image or a table of data used to generate the graph or chart.

To write long text imagine you're describing the essential elements of a complex image in a radio interview.
