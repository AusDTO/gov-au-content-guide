When 2 adjacent words are contracted into 1, an apostrophe is used to show that letters have been left out.

Be aware that low-literacy users, or people from non-English speaking backgrounds, may find contractions difficult to understand.

Always consider the context eg don’t use them in forms.

- don’t (do not)
- it’s (it is)
- let’s (let us)
- they’re (they are)
- they’ve (they have)
- we’ll (we will)
- we’re (we are).

Contractions that include the first and last letter of a word don’t need a full stop.

**For example**

> - Dept
> - Pty Ltd
> - Dr
