Use contractions carefully to make your voice and tone more conversational. Remember that low-literacy users and people with English as another language may find contractions difficult to understand.

Avoid less common coloquial contractions, like you'd.

Contractions that include the first and last letter of a word donâ€™t need a full stop.
