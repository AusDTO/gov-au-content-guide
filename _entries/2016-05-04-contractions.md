Use contractions carefully to make content easier for users.

**For example**

> 'Don't register first. We can't do it until we meet you' is easier for a user than 'Do not register first. We cannot do it until we meet you'.

Remember that low-literacy users and people from non-English speaking backgrounds may find contractions difficult to understand.

Always consider the context, for example don’t use contractions in forms.

**For example**

> - don’t (do not)
> - it’s (it is)
> - let’s (let us)
> - they’re (they are)
> - they’ve (they have)
> - we’ll (we will)
> - we’re (we are)

Contractions that include the first and last letter of a word don’t need a full stop.

**For example**

> Ms, Pty Ltd, Dr
