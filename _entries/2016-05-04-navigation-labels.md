Well written navigation labels reflect the needs of the user and aren't difficult to understand.

Tools that analyse keywords can be helpful when choosing navigation labels.

A navigation label predicts the page it is linking to, and often uses the same wording as the page's title.

**For example**

> Navigation label: News
>
> Page title: Latest news and media releases

Use sentence casing except where there is a proper noun.
