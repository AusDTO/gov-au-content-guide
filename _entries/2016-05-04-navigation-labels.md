## Navigation labels

Well written navigation labels are intuitive, reflective of the userâ€™s needs and never ambiguous.

Keyword analysis tools can be helpful when selecting navigation labels.

A label predicts the page it is linking to, and is often the same word or phrase.

Use sentence casing, except where a proper noun.
