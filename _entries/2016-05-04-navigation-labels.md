Well written navigation labels reflect the needs of the user and aren't difficult to understand.

Tools that analyse keywords can be helpful when choosing navigation labels.

A navigation label predicts the page it is linking to, and is often the same word or phrase.

Use sentence casing except where there is a proper noun.
