Use the most recent edition of the Macquarie Dictionary, and the first option listed.

The default Microsoft Word spell checker setting is US English, which differs from Australian English (for instance, in the spelling of words ending in *ise*, where the American version uses *ize*).

The English UK setting is more similar to Australian spellings.
