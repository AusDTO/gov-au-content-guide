Only use abbreviations of general terms when the abbreviation is the clearer and more common form.

**For example**

> - Ms instead of Miss/Mistress or Mrs/Misses
> - Mr instead of Mister
> - Pty Ltd instead of Proprietary Limited

Abbreviate kilograms, kilojoules, kilometres, kilowatts when using numbers.

**For example**

> 6kg, 6kJ, 6km/h (not 6kph), 6kW

For honours, awards and distinctions, write the abbreviation without full stops.

**For example**

> AO, OM, BA, DipEd, PhD

Abbreviate million, billion and trillion in headings, tables and graphics.

**For example**

> m, bn, tn

For temperatures use °C and °F.

**For example**

> A temperature of 2°C is about the same as 36°F.

Don’t use an acronym unless the full name has already been said once.

**For example**

> Digital Transformation Agency (DTA).

If an acronym is well known to an Australian audience, such as NSW or ABC, there is no need to spell it out. If you are writing for an international audience spell it out once and then use the acronym.

Most acronyms for companies or organisations are uppercase with the exception of Anzac.

Don’t use full stops in acronyms.

**For example**

> ATM not A.T.M.
