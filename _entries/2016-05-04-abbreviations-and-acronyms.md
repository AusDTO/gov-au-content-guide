Abbreviations

Only use abbreviations of general terms when the abbreviation is the clearer and more common form. 

**For example**

> Mr instead of mister

> Pty Ltd instead of Proprietary Limited

> Abbreviation instead of abbrev.

> Department instead of dept.

Abbreviate kilograms, kilojoules, kilometres, kilowatts when using numbers.

**For example**

> 6kg, 6kJ, 6km/h (not 6kph), 6kW

For honours, awards and distinctions, write the abbreviation without full stops.

**For example**

> AO, OM, BA, DipEd, PhD

When referring to people and animals use the words million, trillion and billion. For numbers upwards of 1 million use the abbreviation m, bn and tn. Use m, bn and tn in headings, tables and graphics.

For temperatures use °C and °F.

**For example**

> A temperature of 2°C is about the same as 36°F.

Acronymns

Don’t use an acronym unless the full name has already been said once.

**For example**

> Digital Transformation Office (DTO). 

If an acronym is well known to an Australian audience, such as NSW or ABC, there is no need to spell it out. If you are writing for an international audience spell it out once and then use the acronym.

Most acronyms for companies or organisations are uppercase with the exception of Qantas and Anzac.

Don’t use full stops in acronyms. 

**For example**

> ATM not A.T.M.
