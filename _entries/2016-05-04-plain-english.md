## Plain English

Plain English is clear and easy to understand by everyone regardless of ability.

It uses language that is as simple as the user needs it to be.

Avoid jargon so the user can understand plain English the first time they read it.

Always choose the shorter, plain English word, term, sentence and paragraph over the longer.
