## Screen readers

Screen readers are an assistive technology that helps users who are blind or visually impaired. The technology reads out what is on the screen of a computer or device and lets the user navigate the page.

The clearer your writing, the better the userâ€™s experience of technology. Keep sentences short so their meaning is concise. This reduces the need to listen to a lot of punctuation. Technology can also sometimes miss nuances in longer sentences.

Screen readers can index headings, links and tags to give their users an overview of the page. It is important to use hierarchical headings, links that are embedded in useful text and meaningful image alt text and captions.

This approach to writing gives all users a good experience, regardless of ability.
