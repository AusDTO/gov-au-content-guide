Spell out when not using a number

**For example**

> How many kilometres did they travel?

Abbreviate when using a number. Do not put a space between number and measure.

**For example**

> 6cm, 6kg, 6kJ, 6km/h and 6kW.

Abbreviate in headings, tables and graphics, with or without a number.

Use % when using a number (for example 3%).
