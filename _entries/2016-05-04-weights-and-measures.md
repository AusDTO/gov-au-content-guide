Spell out when not using a number

**For example**

> How many kilometres did they travel?

Abbreviate when using a number and allow a space between

**For example**

> 6 cm, 6 kg, 6 kJ, 6 km/h and 6 kW.

Abbreviate in headings, tables and graphics, with or without a number. Use the percentage sign with a number, eg 3%, otherwise use per cent not percent.
