## Voice

The GOV.AU voice is concise and uses the fewest words possible to meet the userâ€™s need.

See tone

Use the active voice.

Active voice gets straight to the point. Subject-verb-object. 

Passive voice usually makes it difficult to know who did what to whom. Avoid object-verb-subject.  

Like this 
The committee (subject) campaigned (verb) to lower diabetes (object).

Not this
The lowering of diabetes was campaigned for by the committee.


Try using the first and second person instead of the third person to help you to write in the active voice.
