Be concise and use the fewest words possible to meet users' needs.

Use the active voice. Active voice gets straight to the point: subject-verb-object.

Passive voice usually makes it difficult to know who did what to whom. Avoid object-verb-subject.

**For example**

Like this

> The committee (subject) campaigned (verb) to lower diabetes (object).

Not this

> The lowering of diabetes was campaigned for by the committee.

Try using the first and second person instead of the third person to help you to write in the active voice.

**For example**

Like this

> We did not accept your application.

Not this

> It was deemed your application was unsuccessful.

### Using -ings (gerunds)

Rework content to avoid using a gerund (-ings) where possible, for more concise language.

**For example**

Like this

> The system uses data that can be easily updated.

Not this

> The system requires using data that can be easily updated.
