## Bullet point lists

Bullet point lists break up the page and help with readability. 

Use minimal punctuation and add a full stop after the final point. 

**For example**

The environmental protection plan includes:

- a site inspection
- a sustainability report
- ongoing benchmarks.

For full sentences, use a capital letter at the start of each point and end with a full stop.

**For example**

Awareness week agenda

- The director will host a community morning tea.
- The awareness week booklet will be launched.
