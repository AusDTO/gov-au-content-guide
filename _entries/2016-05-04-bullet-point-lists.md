Bullet point lists break up the page and help with readability.

Use minimal punctuation and add a full stop after the final point.

**For example**

> The environmental protection plan includes:
>
> - a site inspection
> - a sustainability report
> - ongoing benchmarks.

For full sentences, use a capital letter at the start of each point and end with a full stop.

**For example**

> Awareness week agenda
>
> - The director will host a community morning tea.
> - The awareness week booklet will be launched.

Rewrite content to avoid second and third level bullet points.

**For example**

Like this

> To register you need to show your referral document to the registrar.
>
> You also need to show 2 forms of identification:
>
> - proof of your name
> - proof of your address.
>
> You can't use the same form of identification for name and address.
>
> Proof of name:
>
> - driver’s license
> - marriage certificate.
>
> Proof of address:
>
> - driver’s license
> - bank statement
> - bill.

Not this

> To register you need to show to the registrar:
>
> - your referral document
> - 2 forms of identification to prove who you are and where you live (you can’t use the same form for both name and address):
>   - proof of name:
>     - driver’s license
>     - marriage certificate
>   - proof of address:
>     - driver’s license
>     - bank statement
>     - bill.
