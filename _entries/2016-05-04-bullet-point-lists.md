Bullet point lists break up the page and help with readability.

Use minimal punctuation and add a full stop after the final point.

**For example**

> The environmental protection plan includes:
>
> - a site inspection
> - a sustainability report
> - ongoing benchmarks.

For full sentences, use a capital letter at the start of each point and end with a full stop.

**For example**

> Awareness week agenda
>
> - The director will host a community morning tea.
> - The awareness week booklet will be launched.

Rewrite content to avoid second level bullet points.

**For example**

Like this

> To register you need proof of
> To register you need to prove your identity and address.
>
> - identity --- for example your driver's license or marriage certificate
> - address --- for example a bank statement or bill.

Not this

> To register you need:
>
> - proof of identity, such as
>   - driver's license
>   - marriage certificate
> - proof of address, such as
>   - bank statement
>   - bill.
