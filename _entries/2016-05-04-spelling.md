Use Australian English spelling (eg ‘ise’ rather than ‘ize’), except when referring to the names of specific organisations, such as the World Health Organization.

### Dictionaries and spell checkers

Use the most recent edition of the Macquarie Dictionary, and the first option listed.

The default Microsoft Word spell checker setting is US English, which differs from Australian English. UK English is safer.

### Americanisms

Avoid using Americanisms, unless the American spelling or term is the commonly accepted online usage.

**For example**

> - You fill in a form, not fill out a form.
> - Shopping cart is the commonly used term for online shopping, not shopping trolley.
