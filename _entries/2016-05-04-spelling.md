## Spelling

Use Australian English spelling (eg ‘ise’ rather than ‘ize’), except when referring to the names of specific organisations, such as the World Health Organization.

### Dictionaries and spell checkers

Use the most recent edition of the Macquarie Dictionary, and the first option listed.

The default Microsoft Word spell checker setting is US English, which differs from Australian English. UK English is safer.

### Americanisms

Avoid using Americanisms, unless the American spelling or term is the commonly accepted online usage.

**For example**

- You *fill in* a form, not *fill out* a form
- Use the *ise* rather than *ize* suffix ie *organise* not *organize*
- *Shopping cart* is the commonly used term for online shopping rather than *shopping trolley*

### Common digital terms

- blog post
- email
- ezine
- elearning
- HTML
- homepage
- internet
- intranet
- login (noun)
- log in (verb)
- online
- PDF
- standalone
- sub-site
- URL
- web
- website
- webpage
- world wide web
- webpage
- XML

### Spellings of words people commonly get wrong

If you're not sure check the dictionary eg the use of *effect* and *affect*.

**For example**

> The effects of climate change had started to affect the way people think about the issue.
