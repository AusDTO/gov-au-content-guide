## Audience

Your writing will be most effective if you understand who you’re writing for.

To understand your audience you should know:
- how they behave and what they’re interested in or worried about – so your writing will catch their attention and answer their questions
- their vocabulary – so that you can use the same terms and phrases they’ll use to search for content.

Make your writing as easy to read as possible so it’s accessible to everyone. We need to communicate in a way that everyone can understand, including specialist content.
