## Headings & subheadings

Headings are the first words users read to check the relevance of content before they commit to reading it.

Make them succinct enough to stand alone so they can be read out of context eg in search results and on social media. 

Keep them short. Googleâ€™s display of a page title typically cuts out at 55 characters. 

Start headings and subheadings with keywords that help your user make a connection. This is called frontloading. 

**Example to come**

Break up a page with useful subheadings that guide the user and help them to know the importance of and relationship between sections of text. 

Avoid meaningless words such as more, related information etc. Instead state what you are describing.

More information

Use an initial capital then lower case (sentence casing), eg Common tax mistakes, except when using proper nouns.

Content should only have 1 top level (H1) heading. Be careful with the number of headings  beyond this. Readers will lose track if there are too many heading levels. Short content should only use 2 extra subheading levels (H2 and H3).
