Headings are the first words users read to check the relevance of content before they commit to reading it.

Make them succinct enough to stand alone so they can be read out of context, for example in search results and on social media.

Keep them short. Googleâ€™s display of a page title typically cuts out at 55 characters.

Start headings and subheadings with keywords that help your user make a connection. This is called frontloading.

**For example**

> Digital communities of practice

Break up a page with useful subheadings that guide the user and help them to know the importance of and relationship between sections of text.

Avoid meaningless words such as 'more' and 'related information'. Instead state what you are describing.

**For example**

Like this

> Smart cities in Europe

Not this

> More information

Use an initial capital then lower case (sentence casing), for example 'Common tax mistakes', except when using proper nouns.

Content should only have 1 top level (H1) heading. Be careful with the number of headings beyond this. Readers will lose track if there are too many heading levels. Short content should only use 2 extra subheading levels (H2 and H3).
