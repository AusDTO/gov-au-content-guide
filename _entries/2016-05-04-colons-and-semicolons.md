Use a colon to lead into a bulleted list after a sentence fragment. Don’t use semicolons at the end of each point.

**Like this**

> The ministers’ community consultations were held in:
>
> - Wagga Wagga
> - Toowoomba
> - Boggabilla
> - Coober Pedy
> - Lismore.

**Not like this**

> The ministers’ community consultations were held in:
>
> - Wagga Wagga;
> - Toowoomba;
> - Boggabilla;
> - Coober Pedy;
> - Lismore.

You can use a colon in a sentence fragment (but bullet lists are more accessible and long sentences can reduce readability).

**For example**

> The community reported they were considering: green solutions, cultural festivals, bush-regeneration programs.
