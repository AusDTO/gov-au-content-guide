Before you write anything, plan the structure of content for your webpage.

**Write a clear title and lead summary**

Tell the user what the page is about and who it's for.

**Use headings and subheadings**

Break up blocks of text and draw in the reader with short, interesting, headings. But remember: readers will lose track if there are too many heading levels.

**Write short paragraphs**

Avoid long blocks of text and limit to one idea per paragraph. Where possible, look to insert a paragraph break every 1-2 sentences, depending on their length.

**Use bullet point lists**

Break up long sentences with lists, making it easier for your reader to understand and scan.

**Make your calls-to-action clear**

Ensure your calls-to-action are visually prominent, user-friendly terms.
