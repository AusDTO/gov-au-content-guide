### Consider placement

Add hyperlinks wherever they are most useful to the user. This includes within paragraphs---although be aware of overcrowding paragraphs with too many links as this can affect readability.

Grouping links together at the bottom of a page (and not within the text) can disrupt readability too. Users may skip the text and just read the links.

As always, think about your users and their context when reading the information. Think helpful. Be precise.

### Link within the paragraph

Users scan links on web pages looking for the pieces of information they need.

To be useful and accessible, embed the link text and make sure the words are precise and can help the user predict where the link leads.

**For example**

> Teachers can [attend education forums](#) outside class time.

Don’t make the link too long. Only link the keywords.

Use this

> Attend next month’s [workshop for developers and writers](#) in Brisbane.

Not this

> [Attend a Brisbane workshop for developers and writers next month](#).

Don’t use meaningless terms such as ‘click here’, ‘read more’ or ‘useful links’.

### Drop the http://

When referencing a website, drop the `http://` prefix.

**For example**

> The Digital Transformation Office’s website is [www.dto.gov.au](https://www.dto.gov.au/).

Include a hyperlink with any emails, without including the `mailto:` prefix.

**For example**

> [belinda.blogs@dto.gov.au](mailto:belinda.blogs@dto.gov.au)
