## Documents

Word documents should never be published on the web as a standalone piece of information.

Instead consider if the information can be presented as an HTML web page, or if really necessary as a PDF. 

If you need to send out a Word document as an email attachment for example, your document needs to be fully accessible by everyone — including people who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers.

The Microsoft Word format does not currently conform to WCAG 2.0 when viewed on a mobile.

Learn how to make [Microsoft Word](http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2012/09/06/video-and-transcripts-microsoft-accessibility-training-sessions/) and [Google Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6199477?hl=en) accessible.
