For images add 'Caption: description of the image...' below the image. Don't duplicate the alt text.

In video post-production use closed captions that articulate what is said or heard.

In addition provide an audio-narration version (where someone narrates the script) for people who cannot see the screen and a text transcript for those who choose to read and not watch.
