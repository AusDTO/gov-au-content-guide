## Usefulness

Useful content always puts the user first. It connects straight to the user’s needs.

Write with a clear purpose and focus on an outcome. Design your content to prioritise information that leads the user through to a call-to-action.

Make sure that it’s up to date and projects an ideal experience of interacting with government.
