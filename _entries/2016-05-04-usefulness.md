Useful content always puts the user first and connects straight to their needs.

To put the user first, write with a clear purpose and focus on an outcome. 

Design your content to structure and prioritise information in a way that leads the user. Use calls-to-action to help users get to where they need to be to do what they need to do.

Always make sure that your content is up to date and can show how the experience of interacting with government can be simple and easy.
