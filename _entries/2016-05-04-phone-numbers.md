Use the following spacing formats, except in forms:

- 6271 1000 for phone numbers in a local area
- 02 6271 1000 for interstate phone numbers not (02) 6721 1000 
- 61 2 6271 1000 for australian numbers dialed from overseas
- 0410 123 456 for mobile numbers
- 1300/1800 123 456 for 10 digit numbers
- 13 13 13 for 6 digit numbers

Users viewing web pages on a mobile device expect that the phone number link that they click on leads to a call been made. Remember all web pages can be accessed internationally.

To create a link for an international number include the international dialling prefix

**For example**

> [61 2 6271 1000](61 2 6271 1000)

It's possible to define the phone number as a link by using tel: before the number within the anchor/link

**For example**

> Please contact us on [tel:02 6271 1000](tel:02 6271 1000)

This is treated as a number users can click on to call.
