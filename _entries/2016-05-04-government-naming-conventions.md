### Government

The words government, group, parliament, state and territory are only capitalised as part of a formal title.

**For example**

> The Australian Government welcomed the delegates.
>
> The delegates were pleased that the government had welcomed them.

Use this

> Australian Government not Commonwealth Government or Federal Government

Use the ‘Commonwealth of Australia’ as the legal entity established by the Constitution.

When referring to the Australian Government as part of a group of governments, set it apart.

Like this

> Australian Government and state and territory governments.

Not this

> Australian and state and territory governments.

When referring to government departments write the department’s name in full on first mention and then as 'the department'.

**For example**

> The Department for Communication and the Arts is the Australian Government’s leading advisor on communications. Our department is based in Canberra.

Use first person pronouns through the rest of the text eg 'we, us'.

When naming other departments, use the name in full followed by the acronym in brackets.

**For example**

> Our department worked closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).  

When referring to ministers and members of parliament refer to the minister by full title in the first instance, and then as the minister.

Like this

> The Honourable Minister for Education, [insert name], opened the stadium. The minister left after morning tea.

or use this

> The Member for Bligh, [insert name], MP.

Not this

> The Federal Member for Bligh [insert name].

When referring to states and territories only capitalise when referring to a formal state or territory government title.

**For example**

> ACT Government
> Government of South Australia
> Government of Victoria
> Government of Western Australia
> NSW Government
> Northern Territory Government
> Queensland Government
> Tasmanian Government

The preferred style is to use the name of states and territories in full.

When space is limited, such as in a table or to avoid lengthy repetitions, use contractions and acronyms.

**For example**

> Australian Capital Territory -- ACT
> New South Wales -- NSW
> Northern Territory -- NT
> Queensland -- Qld
> South Australia -- SA
> Tasmania -- Tas.
> Victoria -- Vic.
> Western Australia -- WA
