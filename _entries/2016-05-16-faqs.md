We discourage FAQs. They date easily and suggest that the website information is out of touch with its usersâ€™ needs. 

Answers to important questions should sit naturally in context on a website, where users expect to find them. 

Question why you need FAQs, but when essential be sure they are useful, well-edited and link to relevant information.  

They need to be regularly updated through feedback loops and grouped under topics for quick reference.
