Commas should be used minimally. They are useful for enhancing clarity because they bring in a natural pause. But using too many can indicate that you’re using too many words. Try shortening your sentences instead.

**For example**

Like this

> After the proposal had been discussed at length in Cabinet, a media release was issued.

Or this

> The proposal, that was discussed in Cabinet, prompted a media release.

But not like this

> The proposal, was discussed at length in Cabinet and prompted a media release.

Or not like this

> The minister brought in 3 viewpoints and, she spoke to the whole team.

Do not use an Oxford comma---eg in a sentence before the final ‘and’ or ‘or’ in a list.

**For example**

> We share stories from our user research to identify positives, negatives, opportunities and themes.

Alternatively, shorten the sentence to a 1 idea or use a bulleted list.
