## Video

Video can be a great way of getting information across. Users prefer short clips (around 2-3 minutes) and will drop out if the video is too long.

Write the script with your audience in mind.

Get to the point as early as possible.

Think visually. Use imagery to describe what you’re saying where possible to reduce the narrative ie show don’t tell.

Make videos accessible by applying closed captions and an audio narration or alternative such as a text transcript.

Also ensure access is taken into account for:

- visual impairment
- hearing impairment
- mobility–restricted keyboard access
- flickering and moving content
- language difficulty
- non-conducive environments (for example, a noisy environment or a workplace where the sound disturbs colleagues).
