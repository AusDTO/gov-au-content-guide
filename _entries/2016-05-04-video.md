Video can be a great way of getting information across to an audience. People prefer videos that are around 2 -- 3 minutes long. The longer a video, the harder it is to keep people engaged.

Write the script with your audience in mind and get to the point early on.

Think visually, what's shown on the video should describe what is been said to reduce the narrative ie show don’t tell.

Create accessible videos using closed captions, audio narration or another alternative such as a text transcript available in HTML.

Also ensure access is taken into account for:
- visual impairment
- hearing impairment
- mobility –- restricted keyboard access
- flickering and moving content
- language difficulty
- non--conducive environments, eg a noisy environment or a workplace where the sound disturbs colleagues.
