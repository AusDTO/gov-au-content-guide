No punctuation is used for dates.

**For example**

> On Tuesday 8 October 2016. Not 8th October, 2016.

Time periods: use numbers.

**For example**

> 19th century instead of nineteenth century.

Use ‘to’ in time and date ranges---not hyphens or en dashes.

**For example**

> - GovHack runs 29 to 31 July 2016.
> - We are open Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm.

Use numbers at the beginning of a line, bulleted item or sentence.

**For example**

> 19th century works of art.
