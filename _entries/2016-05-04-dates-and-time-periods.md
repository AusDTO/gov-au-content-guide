No punctuation is used for dates.

**For example**

> On Tuesday 8 October 2016. Not 8th October, 2016.

Time periods: use numbers.

**For example**

> 19th century instead of nineteenth century.

To indicate spans of time, use from ... to ... or dashes. From ... to ... is easier to read.

**For example**

> - from 10 to 12 October, or 10–12 October
> - from 10am to 11am, or 10am–11am.

Use numbers at the beginning of a line, bulleted item or sentence.

**For example**

> 19th century works of art.
