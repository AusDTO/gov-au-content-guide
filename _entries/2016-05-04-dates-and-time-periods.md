No punctuation is used for dates eg on Tuesday 8 October 2016 not 8th October, 2016.

Time periods: use numbers eg 19th century instead of nineteenth century.

To indicate spans of time, use from ... to ... or dashes. From ... to ... is easier to read:

> from 10 to 12 October or 10–12 October
> from 10 am to 11 am or 10 am–11 am.

Use numbers at the beginning of a line, bulleted item or sentence eg 19th century works of art.
