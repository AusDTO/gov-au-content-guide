Capital letters are hard to read. Keep them to a minimum.

Use sentence case for most things. Use title case for proper nouns.

**For example**

> The city is in south-east New South Wales.

### When to use capital letters

#### First letter in headings and subheadings

**For example**

> Business innovation incentives

#### In proper nouns

**For example**

> Parliament House, Australia Post, the Australian Government but then the government.

#### Titles

**For example**

> Minister Michael Jones but then the minister.

#### Department titles

**For example**

> Department of Communications and Arts, but then the department.

#### Legislation, publications, policies, programs, titles and reports

**For example**

> - the Government Information Public Access Act, then the Act
> - Read Steps to Enter Residential Aged Care before our workshop.

### More examples

> - the internet, not the Internet
> - the web, not the Web or World Wide Web
> - the intranet, not the Intranet
> - wi-fi --- not wifi, WiFi or Wi-fi
