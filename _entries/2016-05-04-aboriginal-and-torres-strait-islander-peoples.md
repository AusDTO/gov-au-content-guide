### A point about using ‘Indigenous’

While it is Australian Government practice to refer to Indigenous Australians, this is not preferred by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Find an alternative when you can, especially when referring to individuals.

Indigenous is the common term when referring to a business entity or business function, for example Indigenous Specialist Officer, Indigenous Services Branch etc.

Indigenous should always be capitalised.

### Correct spelling of cultural terms

- On Country
- Sorry Business
- Men’s Business
- Women’s Business
- Traditional Owners or Traditional Custodians
