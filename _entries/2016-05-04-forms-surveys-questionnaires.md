## Forms, surveys & questionnaires


**Forms**

Forms must be written using simple language in plain English.

Think about the user’s need and what you want them to achieve.

Call the form something which explains the task and add a short description.

**For example**

Title: School enrolment form
Brief description: Enrol your child in a NSW public school

Be helpful. If extra documents are required to complete the form, offer a list under a subheading. 

**For example**

What you need to complete this form

- Driver’s licence
- Passport
- Birth certificate
- Utilities bill.

If you are collecting personal details, preface with a sentence to reassure them. 

**For example**

We will not collect, use or store your personal data for any purpose other than as stated in this form. See our privacy statement.

Forms should be tested for usability and accessibility.

If a form is to be printed, scanned or emailed, provide a contact support phone number alongside a PDF download.

Make sure they are accessible. Keep them short and relevant.

Use the title to remind the user what they are being asked about.

**For example**

Title: School canteen survey

Brief description: Have your say about our proposed new canteen menu.

Indicate how how long it will take to complete. 

Questions are deceptively hard to write. 

A good question has no ambiguity and is accompanied by a short explanation of why you are asking it. When using an open-ended question consider how you are going to report on that data.
