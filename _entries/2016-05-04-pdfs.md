HTML content should be the default format for all government information. This includes content that was previously available in Portable Document Format (PDF).

On mobile devices, PDFs do not comply with [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) due to a lack of consistency in assistive technology. PDFs are also difficult for many users to access on smaller screens. Users may choose not to open a PDF and this means information is hidden.

People are also aware of how much data they use especially on mobile devices. Downloading large files, eg over 1MB, can be difficult especially in regional and remote places.

If there is a strong user need to provide a PDF (eg a PDF form for printing) it must be accessible. You also need to make the form available in another format such as HTML.

To make a PDF accessible you must structure it so a screen reader follows the logical order of the content (structural hierarchy) in the PDF. For guidance on how to do this read:

- [PDF Techniques for WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140408/pdf.html)
- [Adobe - Accessibility for Adobe Acrobat](http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/acrobat.html)
- [Adobe - Accessibility for Adobe InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/indesign.html).

Always tell your users that they are downloading a PDF. Include the file size and a summary of what the PDF is about. Provide a contact, eg an email address, so users can request the information in a different format.

**For example**

> [Sustainable farming guide 472KB PDF]()
>
> A guide to sustainable farming.
>
> Email [digital@digital.gov.au]() to request a different format.
