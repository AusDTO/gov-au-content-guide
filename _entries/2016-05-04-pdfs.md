HTML content should be the default format for all government information. This includes content that was previously available as a Portable Document Format (PDF).

On mobile devices, PDFs don't comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 due to a lack of reliable assistive technology. PDFs are also difficult for many users to access on smaller screens. Users may choose not to open a PDF, which means information is hidden.

People are also aware of how much data (especially on mobile devices) they use and downloading large files eg over 1MB can be difficult especially in regional and remote places.

If you can demonstrate a strong user need to provide users with a PDF, eg a PDF form for printing, you must create an accessible PDF and it should not be the only format of the form avialble to your users.

For a PDF to be accessible, a screen reader needs to know the logical order of the content (structural heirachy) in the PDF, see:
[PDF Techniques for WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140408/pdf.html "PDF Techniques for WCAG 2.0")
[Adobe - Accessibility for Adobe Acrobat](http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/acrobat.html "Adobe - Accessibility for Adobe Acrobat")
[Adobe - Accessibility for Adobe InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/indesign.html "Adobe - Accessibility for Adobe InDesign")

Always indicate to your users that they are downloading a PDF, include the file size and a summary of what the PDF is and a contact, eg a email, for users to request the information in a different format.

**For example**

> [Sustainable farming guide 472KB PDF]()
> 
> A guide to sustainable farming. 
>
> Email [digital@digital.gov.au]() to request a different format.
