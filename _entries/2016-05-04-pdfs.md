HTML content should be the default format for all government information.

This includes content that was previously available as a PDF.

PDFs do not currently comply with WCAG 2.0 (undefined?) on mobile devices due to lack of assistive technology support. They can also be difficult for many users to access on small screen mobile devices.

Many users choose not to open them, which means the information remains hidden.

Plus people are often conscious of data consumption (especially on mobile devices) and downloading large files can be difficult in regional areas.

If you can demonstrate a strong user need, for example a printable PDF form, the document must be fully accessible and PDF should not be the only source. It should always be accompanied by a summary covering key points and contact details if users are having problems they can follow up.

Screen readers need to be able to access a PDFâ€™s structural hierarchy. See [PDF Techniques for WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/pdf.html "PDF Techniques for WCAG 2.0")

If the PDF must be published, always indicate to the user that they are downloading a PDF and include the file size.
