## Accessibility

Content must be designed to be readily navigated, scanned and understood by all users regardless of ability.

In government we must comply with accessibility standards for websites, including digital information and publications distributed via a website.

All government information must be available to all online users.

### Accessibility tips

- Use hierarchical headings (`H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`) for page structure with meaningful text
- Use bulleted lists where possible
- Write link text that makes sense out of context
- Make sure there is sufficient contrast between any text and the background
- Use dot, dashes and patterns in graphs in addition to colour for differentiating different data
- Provide alt text for images
- Provide transcripts and captions for video and audio
