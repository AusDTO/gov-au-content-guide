## Titles

Capitalise a formal title but not when using it as a noun or an adjective.

**For example**

> The Minister for Communications ... the minister ... ministers ... ministerial

Capitalise specific references to the current prime minister but not when referring to a former prime minister.

**For example**

> The Prime Minister, Bob Hawke
>
> The former prime minister, Sir Edmund Barton.

Capitalise to distinguish from the common noun or generic meaning.  

**For example**

- Aboriginal Elder
- the Cabinet
- the Treasury
- the Crown
- the House–referring to either parliamentary chamber
- the Budget but—budget provisions, the budgetary process, successive budgets etc.

Title contractions do not require punctuation.

**For example**

- Ms
- Mr
- Mrs
- Dr
- Prof
