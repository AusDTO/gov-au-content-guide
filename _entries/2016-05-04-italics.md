For Latin words, use plain English where you can.

**For example** 

> 'He talked for a long time' instead of 'He talked _ad infinitum_'.

An exception would be for scientific names.

Latin is a recognised language option and should be declared as such in the HTML in order for the screen reader to get the pronunciation right.

Never use italics in headlines.
