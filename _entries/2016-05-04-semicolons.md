Donâ€™t use them. Start a new sentence, create a list of similar ideas or topics, or use ie instead.

**For example**

Like this

> We want to make information:
> 
> - simpler
> - clearer
> - faster.

Or this

> We want to make information simpler, clearer and faster.

Not this

> We want to make information simpler; clearer; and faster.
