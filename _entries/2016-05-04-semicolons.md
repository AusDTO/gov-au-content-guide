Use shorter sentences, em dashes or lists rather than semicolons.

**For example**

Like this

> Make simpler, clearer and faster information.

Or this

> Make information:
>
> - simpler
> - clearer
> - faster.

Or this

> Make information simpler and clearer --- and faster.

Not this

> Make information that is simpler and clearer; and also faster.
