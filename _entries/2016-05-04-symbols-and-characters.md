## Symbols & characters

For ampersands, don’t use an ‘&’ in the place of ‘and’ in a sentence or organisation name (unless it already exists).

Use ‘&’ in headings, subheadings, navigation labels and graphics.

For percentage use % with numbers eg *3%* and in headers, tables and graphics. Otherwise use per cent, not percent. *Percentage* is one word.

Use the *@* symbol in email addresses and Twitter/Instagram handles only.
