For ampersands, donâ€™t use an & in the place of and or in a sentence or organisation name (unless it already exists).

Use & in headings, subheadings, navigation labels and graphics.

For percentage use % with numbers, eg 3%, and in headers, tables and graphics. Otherwise use per cent, not percent. Percentage is one word.

Use the @ symbol in email addresses and social media handles only.
