Use ellipses ( ... ) after text when deliberately leaving something out, for example in the middle of a long quote.

**For example**

> Full quotation: 'Today, after user research, we analysed the results.'
>
> With ellipsis: 'Today ... we analysed the results.'

Use a space on either side of the ellipsis except when followed by a question mark.

**For example**

> "What did you say? 'Today we did ...? and then analysed the results'?"
